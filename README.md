# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is my first Python project on GitHub!

A simple game where the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess it.

## 🚀 Features
- Random number generation  
- “Too high / Too low” hints  
- Counts how many tries you take  
- Handles invalid inputs  

## 🧠 How to Run
1. Copy the code from `guess_game.py`
2. Run it in your local Python environment:
   ```bash
   python guess_game.py
